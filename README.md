# AI-Powered Clothing Recommendation System

## Overview
#### This project is an AI-powered clothing recommendation system that integrates Vanna AI with OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo and interacts with an SQLite database containing various clothing items categorized by occasion, material, brand, size, and more. The system allows users to ask queries related to clothing items, and the AI provides relevant recommendations and details from the database based on their input.
